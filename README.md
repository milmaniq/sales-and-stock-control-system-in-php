# Sales and Installment based Order System

This system is a Web Application that can be implemented in a Jewellery Store. 
It has the functionality to record Customer Sales.
When making sales, it is very important to specify the Jewellery Items.
Therefore, the jewellery items must be added to the database prior to making a sale.
After making a sale, this system has the functionality to remove the sold jewellery items from the stock.
Further, for each Sale, a Bill would be generated.
Moreover, it is also possible to add new Employees to the database and manage them efficiently.
Therefore, it can be said that this system is a complete Sales and Stock Control System for a Jewellery Store.
